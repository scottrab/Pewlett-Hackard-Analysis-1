# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
Given a task by a manager at Pewlett Hackard, determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. To get started, we will use pgAdmin to write queries and create tables for the two items mentioned.

## Results
In deliverable 1, we created a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.
* There are 7 titles that will need to be replaced once these employees retire. 
* The largest number in retirement goes to Senior Engineers with 29,414 employees.
* The second largest number in retirement goes to Senior Staff with 28,254 employees. 

In deliverable 2, we created a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.
* There is a total of 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship.
* A total of 529 eligible employees are Senior Engineers. 
* A total of 569 eligible employees are Senior staff.
* Many positions will open up as employees from these two concerned titles begin to retire. Pewlett Hackard will need to hire a lot of employees to fill the open positions. 

## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

90,398 employees will potentially leave the company and only 1,549 are eligible as mentors. This leaves the company with 88,849 open positions that need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There is not enough retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of pewlett Hackard employees. Taking Senior Engineers and Senior Staffs as an example. The amount of people that will retire from these two departments is simply too high compared to the number of employees who are eligible to become mentors. Pewlett Hackard will need to hire a lot of new employees to fill these open positions. 

- Additional Queries

Finding the number of eligible employees for mentorship versus retiring employees count based on title. This way, we can see how each role is affected by the number of retiring employees and mentorship eligibilty count.

Another thing to look into would be gender. Finding out how gender plays into the role of retirement and its percentage in the upcoming "silver tsunami".
